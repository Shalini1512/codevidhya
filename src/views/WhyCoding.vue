              In this digital era, every second job is tech job and our schools
              are still teaching only simple operations like left-clicking –
              right-clicking the mouse which students can learn easily in no
              time. We need to impart life skills to students and make them
              ready for future jobs. After all, Coding is the next level of

                  Tanmay Bakshi is nothing like the average child you would
                  meet. The twelve-year-old was first drawn to programming
                  languages. When he was but five and wondered how his name
                  could be displayed on his dad’s computer screen, he set out on
                  a quest to solve simple mysteries that intrigued him and
                  started programming with his father’s help, and he is one of
                  the youngest app developers in the world today.

              Coding is one of the most used language in the world. In this era,
              where most jobs involve programming and dealing with software,
              coding has now become the popular language worldwide. Considering
              this picture in mind, we should start teaching coding as a part of
              literacy in the digital era.
