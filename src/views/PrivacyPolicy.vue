                        requires a validated login with the School’s cloud
                        platform, and all interactions with such content are

                        with the Customer, the class, and the student
                        identifiers. We do not make such content publically
                        accessible, and use it only to provide the required

                      <p>
                        Codevidhya takes very seriously the security and privacy
                        of the personal information that it collects pursuant to
                        this privacy policy. Accordingly, we will implement
                        reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect
                        such personal information from loss, misuse and
                        unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and
                        destruction, taking into account the risks involved in
                        processing and the nature of such data, and comply with
                        applicable laws and regulations. Access to such personal
                        information is limited to those of our employees who
                        require it to perform their job functions. We also use
                        two-factor authentication, SSL (Secure Socket Layer)
                        encryption, physical access controls to files and
                        buildings, and other industry-standard best practices.
                        School Information is transferred to Codevidhya servers
                        through a secure Web site, or secure file transfer
                        protocol based on industry-standard encryption

                        are under 13, please do not give us any personal
                        information. We encourage parents and legal guardians to
                        monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help
                        enforce our privacy policy by instructing their children
                        never to provide personal information to us without
                        their permission. If you have reason to believe that a
                        child under the age of 13 has provided personal
