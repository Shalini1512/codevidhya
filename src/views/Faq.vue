								<p>Codevidhya is an EdTech company dedicated to converting classrooms into Programming Powerhouses and inculcating the “Next Level of Literacy” in the form of <b>Computer Programming – Coding.</b> Codevidhya strongly believes that the current education framework is not preparing the workforce to be qualified enough for the jobs of the future that shall be driven by tech. With an aim to equip our future generations with the required skills and bringing about the much-needed paradigm shift in the education vertical, we have scientifically developed a Computer Science Curriculum for schools with strong emphasis on the importance of Coding by starting as early as Grade 1. This curriculum comes with a suite of offerings like Curriculum Textbooks, Teachers Training & Certification, Students Workshops, Access to Online Platform & Resources, Events like Hour of Code, Skill Certification, Annual Project Mentorship, etc. which ensures effective & impactful delivery of the curriculum.</p>

								<p> In the era of technology, Coding is the life skill that everyone should have to full-fill the needs of future in terms of employment, business and innovation. We have well-researched computer programming based academic curriculum that is based on “<b>Learn by Doing</b>” approach to make it a life skill for students. From the school curriculum perspective something new and innovative is always looked forward to and also we know parents always want their child to learn something new in the school, so this is the solution. We not only provide the basic knowledge of Computer Science but going a step ahead, we implement new concepts of learning coding at a very young age that is age specific.</p>

								<p>It will be a great advantage for the school if the teachers are from coding background as implementation of the program in the school will be smoother. If not, we provide full support to the teachers in terms of training and solving their every problem while implementing this curriculum.

								<p>No, the school doesn’t need to burden itself with the hiring of additional teachers with separate skills. Teachers with Computer Science background can very efficiently implement the program in the school. And if they face any challenges, that’s where Codevidhya support and mentoring comes in picture. We ensure round the year support to address any concerns.</p>

								<p>Our annual school program comes as a complete package which includes our books and other support and service which we had discussed earlier. Like all other curriculums, as the student progresses in terms of grades, his/her textbooks also get upgraded according to his/her class.  And the package gets renewed every year.The cost would be that of the package which might witness a slight increase as per the market dynamics.</p>

								<p>Apart from trainings and workshops for teachers and students, which are all a part of the package, we also conduct Hour of Code, Code Challenges (Ideathon) as a mandate. Also, students are awarded Hour of Code participation and Skill Certificate which are based on the round the year performance and progression of the students. Codevidhya also provides project mentoring to the students for their year-end project. We also share all the updates and information with the partner schools about the Competitions and Events like Google Science Fair by Google etc. and provide guidance and assistance as per the need.</p>
								<p>Also, as per the need of the school, we are open to organizing Coding Camps or Events as a part of the Branding strategy for the school wherein we can organize coding competitions and display the projects and works of the children.</p>
