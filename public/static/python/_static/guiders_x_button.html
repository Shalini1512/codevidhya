<h1>Sorry, Something went wrong</h1>
<p>The error is: <code>invalid request</code></p>
<p>We recently reorganized the books, and so some of the chapters have new links.  Please go to the table of contents for your book and navigate to the desired section from there.  <a href="http://interactivepython.org">Our Home Page is a good starting point</a></p>
<p>If you got an <code>invalid request</code> were hoping to find a course in /static/mycourse/xxxx.html  That course may need to be rebuilt, or the course may no longer be available.
Please contact your instructor.  If you are an instructor then go to the <a href="/runestone/admin/index">Instructors Page</a> and follow
the instructions to rebuild or create your course.</p>
<p>For any other error, please report this on <a href="http://github.com/bnmnetp/runestone/issues">our github page</a>  (github account required)
Or, tweet us <a href="http://twitter.com/iRunestone">@iRunestone</a>  Please try to include the error message, and the page you were trying to get to.
